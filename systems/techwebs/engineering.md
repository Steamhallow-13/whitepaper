# "Engineering" (temp) Techweb

Unlike Magic's traditional research techweb, engineering takes full advantage of; and abuse in - alchemy. Engineering's techweb involves mechanics similar to
Minecraft's ProjectE. Engineering's techweb, and designs, make heavy use of alchemical fluid as a material source; standing in for SS13's traditional bluespace
ore silo. This can be found in the 'reservoir'; but is also pumped throughout the city via underground pipes to different vending units.

Vending units; (temp), are combination lathes, vending machines; and pawnshops. They can:

- Print any item in the techweb in exchange for alchemical fluid.
- Exchange any item given to them for slightly-less-than-monetary value.
- Any valid new item given to them will automatically be added to the Engineering techweb and can be printed from applicable machines in future.
