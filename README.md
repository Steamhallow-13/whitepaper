# SteamHallow 13
*Introductive Overview*
SteamHallow 13 is a modernized; /tg/station-derived medieval/early steampunk fantasy h/erp codebase; focusing on long-term character development and character conflict driven through in-game systems.
The guiding principles for SteamHallow 13 are as follows:
- The game must be engaging to sandbox in; even entirely alone - but must not also goad player engagement when unwanted, to make room for roleplay.
- All fantasy servers prior have focused on 'grimshart' tonation. In contrast; SteamHallow 13 should focus on early upliftment into a steampunk setting.
- As much of what makes SS13 "SS13" should be challenged; warped; and molded for the better. While we may not be running an atmospherics simulator anymore; we want what's left, and what's new; to flow well and fit within the context of SS13 as a whole.
- Any and all catering to ERP should take player safety into consideration.
